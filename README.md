# MyProject

## Description

This project was developed as part of my university coursework. It is a web application that demonstrates the use of modern Java-based technologies for building dynamic web systems with a connection to a database.  
The application includes a shopping cart feature, where users can add, remove, and edit items.

## Technologies Used

- **Java** – core programming language  
- **Spring Boot** – framework for building the backend  
- **Hibernate** – ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for database operations  
- **SQL** – database communication  
- **Thymeleaf** – server-side Java template engine for rendering HTML  
- **HTML & CSS** – frontend structure and styling
